## Nutrition & Metabolism

### TDEE & Energy Expenditure

Understanding your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the foundation for any physique, performance, or health goal. The field has several competing equations — each with different accuracy profiles depending on population.

**Comparison of key equations:**

| Equation | Variables | Best For |
|----------|-----------|----------|

| Mifflin-St Jeor (1990) | Sex, weight, height, age | General adult population |
| Katch-McArdle | Lean body mass | Athletes with known body fat |
| Cunningham | Lean body mass | Endurance athletes |

```
Mifflin-St Jeor:
  Men:   BMR = 10×weight(kg) + 6.25×height(cm) - 5×age + 5
  Women: BMR = 10×weight(kg) + 6.25×height(cm) - 5×age - 161

Katch-McArdle:
  BMR = 370 + (21.6 × LBM)
  LBM = weight × (1 - body_fat_fraction)
```
